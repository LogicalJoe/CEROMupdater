By LogicalJoe

CEromupdater is a simple commandline program that can take a CE's ROM's bootcode and an 8ek OS's basecode and combine them into a single minimalistic ROM.  
It is used as follows:

`CEromupdater [rom in] [os in] [rom out]`

And a help screen can be accessed as follows:

`CEromupdater --help`
