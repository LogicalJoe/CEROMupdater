# CEromupdater

CEromupdater is a simple commandline program that can take a ROM's bootcode and an OS's basecode and combine them into a single minimalistic ROM.  
It is used as follows:

`CEromupdater [rom in] [os in] [rom out]`

And a help screen can be accessed as follows:

`CEromupdater --help`

I am not liable for any damageor dataloss to your machine this program may (though unlikely will) cause.
